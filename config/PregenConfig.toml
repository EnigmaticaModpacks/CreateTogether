	#Defines if the SyncChunkWrite config should be not forcefully set to false. Note: SyncChunkWrite "May" Prevent data corruption. Though this was only enabled since 1.16 before it was always disabled. Downside of this is that HDDs/SSDs during pregen are at 100% usage ALL the time instead of less then 5%. This can lead to hardware failure much much much much more quickly. This is why the override is enabled by default
